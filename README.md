# Screensizes

[Check it out on the live site!](https://screensizes.org) It displays visitors' screen sizes in real-time.

Inspired by the visualization on Brad Frost's [This Is Responsive](https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/).

## Use this on your own site

There's a route called `/screen` which takes two params:

* `w` is the width
* `h` is the height

You can measure these on the client-side by checking `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight`. Then just GET the URL and supply the two dimensions. The server handles the rest!

```
/screen?w=480&h=640
```
